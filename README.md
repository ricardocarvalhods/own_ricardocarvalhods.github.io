Simple blog to get pages written in markdown (with equations) and render in a simple website.

It uses:

- [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown): To convert markdown to html.
- [katex](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX): For LaTeX math rendering.

.. and the rest is just simple HTML+CSS+Javascript.
