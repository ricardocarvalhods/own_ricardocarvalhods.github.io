# ricardocarvalhods.github.io

Simple website to get pages written in markdown (supporting equations, emojis, etc.) and render in a simple way.

The idea is to load everything directly from github, not compilation or preprocessing to make it work.

It uses:

- [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown): To convert markdown to html.
- [katex](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX): For LaTeX math rendering.

.. and the rest is just simple HTML+CSS+Javascript (jQuery).
